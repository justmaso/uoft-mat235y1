To prepare for the term test, you should focus on reviewing your lecture notes, the tutorial problems, and the relevant sections from the textbook (including the assigned textbook problems). For extra practice, you can also make use of the WileyPLUS material.

To aid in your preparation for Term Test 1, we here is a practice test from last year which you can use to gauge your level of preparedness and in order to simulate the actual test:

**Please read the comments below before attempting the practice test**. In particular, we strongly recommend not attempting the practice test until you are mostly ready for the real Term Test 1.
- This practice test does not necessarily reflect the exact distribution of content which will appear on the real test. Some topics on the practice test may not appear on the real test; conversely, some topics on the real test may not be represented on the practice test.
- We recommend not attempting the practice test until you are at least 75% ready for the real test. Use the results to re-calibrate before the real test.
- We strongly recommend not looking at any solutions to the practice test before attempting it.
- The number of marks associated to each problem is meant to give you an idea of how much a similar problem would be worth on the real test.
- Suggestions on how to use the practice test:
    - Find a quiet place where you can work with minimal interruptions for 90 minutes.
    - Put away all books, notes and calculators.
    - Once you are ready, begin timing yourself. Pause only if absolutely necessary. Try to mimic an actual test scenario.
    - Once you are done, evaluate your performance. What went well? What didn't go well? What do you still have to review? What do you not have to review anymore?
